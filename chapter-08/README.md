# CHAPTER - 8: Type Conversion, Type Aliases, and Type Deduction
 
Implicit type Conversion 
Implicit type conversion (also called automatic type conversion or coercion) is performed automatically by the compiler when one data type is required, but a different data type is supplied. The vast majority of type conversions in C++ are implicit type conversions.
Conversions do not change the value or type being converted. Instead, a new value with the desired type is created as a result of the conversion.
